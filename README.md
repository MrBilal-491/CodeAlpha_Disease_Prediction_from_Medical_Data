# CodeAlpha_Disease_Prediction_from_Medical_Data
The main goal of this project is to develop a disease prediction model using structured patient data such as test results, demographic information, and medical features. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to predict the presence or absence of a disease, thereby assisting in early diagnosis and better treatment planning.
